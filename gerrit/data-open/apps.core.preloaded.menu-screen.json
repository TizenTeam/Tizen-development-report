Deploy this method to menu-screen package.\nCurrently we need \"pure wayland platform (no X11)\" status,so \"with wayland\" and \"with x\" are\ndefined into \"1\" and \"0\" in build.conf file.If you need other status of above illustration,\nplease change values of \"with x\" and \"with wayland\" in your build.conf file.\n\nSigned-off-by: wangfei \u003cfeix.w.wang@intel.com\u003e\nChange-Id:
