Add more details description in the commit comments, for example, what\u0027s hotspot, what is it used for and so on.\n2. It\u0027s better to divide the new feature patch into several small patches according to the functionality atoms? which will be more easier to review and maintain.\nThanks!"},{"timestamp":1388754114,"reviewer":{"name":"Patrik Flykt","email":"patrik.flykt@intel.com","username":"pflykt"},"message":"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1\n\nI\u0027d agree with Zhang that a good description of the functionality is needed and that the patch be split up into smaller parts making it easier to understand the various changes."},{"timestamp":1389306475,"reviewer":{"name":"Martin Xu","email":"martin.xu@intel.com","username":"martin"},"message":"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2\n\nHi:\r\nAccording to our Tizen Comms Development mode. the new feauture should happen at upstream firstly before we merge to Tizen.\r\n\r\nSo the right process is that you should discuss the new feature at ConnMan upstream. And submit patches there.\r\n\r\nafter the the patches are merged into ConnMan uptream we then can upgrade ConnMan and merge the new feature.\r\n\r\nOnly when the new feautre can\u0027t be accecpted by upstream and then we need to decide whether we need to handle that at Tizen firstly.

By the time this HS2.0 feature is done, tizen.org should have been upgraded to 2.21 or later already - meaning there is less work doing the new feature upstream and then upgrading ConnMan only once for tizen.org. With development being done on 1.15, there is even more forward-porting effort next time an up to date version of ConnMan is considered and taken into use."}]}
