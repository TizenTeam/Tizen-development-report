The tunnel sink and source have so\nfar been using pa_mainloop, but there are some modules that assume\nthat all sinks and sources use pa_rtpoll in their IO threads, and\ntrying to use those modules together with the pa_mainloop based\ntunnel sinks and sources will result in crashes (see [1]).\n\nI will switch the event loop implementation in the tunnel modules\nto pa_rtpoll, but that requires a pa_mainloop_api implementation in\npa_rtpoll first - that\u0027s implemented here.\n\npa_rtpoll_run() is changed so that it processes all defer events\nfirst, and then all expired time events. The rest of pa_rtpoll_run()\nworks as before, except the poll timeout calculation now has to also\ntake the time events into account. IO events use the existing\npa_rtpoll_item interface.\n\nThe time events are handled separately from the old timer\nfunctionality, which is somewhat ugly. It might be a good idea to\nremove the old timer functionality and only use the time events.\nI didn\u0027t attempt to do that at this time, because I feared that\nadapting the pa_rtpoll users to the new system would be difficult.\n\n[1] https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d73429\n\nChange-Id: I4f9a92efbdbb868547ee3422538936f8de5d971e\n","createdOn":1420201272,"lastUpdated":1420201272,"sortKey":"0032326500008113","open":true,"status":"NEW","comments":[{"timestamp":1420201272,"reviewer":{"name":"Tanu Kaskinen","email":"tanu.kaskinen@linux.intel.com","username":"tanuk"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 1."}]}
