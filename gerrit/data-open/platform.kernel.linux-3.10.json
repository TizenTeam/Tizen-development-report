In case of OdroidU3+ there more logic needed than simple mapping gpio pins into cable values. This driver is also responsible of switching OTG VBUS power signal, like it is done in other extcon drivers (like MAX77693). To make things clear I will probably squash all the patches to extcon-odroid-usbotg driver into one to avoid confusion and resubmit to gerrit."}]}
