As you know it does not consider about 64 bits archs so it passed the character pointer value to int by force typecasting. To fix it, many logic should be fixed together. So I have a plan to proposal new OAL module structure soon. In brief, if there is a common interface on kernel side, I think OAL module is not needed but in another case it should be needed a wrapper function to implement code in accordance with their kernel or device driver side. But it\u0027s just my idea so if you have any idea about OAL module, please let me know. Thank you."}]}
