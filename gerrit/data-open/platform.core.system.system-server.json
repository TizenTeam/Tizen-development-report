In this patch syspopup calls are replaced by notification CAPI calls. There is no UI calls and logic. This patch just sends notifcations to notification-service and waits for its reply.\n\nThen there is a new module notification-display-service that aims to display received notifications as popups according to the graphical toolkits in place (for the moment, it displays Wayland or X window popups). The goal is to have some popups that can be displayed by any homescreen type (EFL, Qt, HTML5, ...).\n\n\nFinaly, this patch is proposed in system-server as it is deployed right now. We know that deviced will replace system-server and it is a good thing. I guess that will occur after IVI/Common releases.\n\nBtw, before merging, we will need to adapt deviced to notifications popup as well."}]}
