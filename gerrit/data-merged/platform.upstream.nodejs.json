That is to say that just like with cpan for perl, you use npm to down load modules to your system from a huge database of modules on an internet server.\n\nA distribution typically doesn\u0027t have a package just call into cpan, but instead actually grabs the source at packaging time and makes a proper package out of it like we do in tizen with tizen rpm\u0027s for various perl modules.  Not having cpan does not mean you can not use a perl module, it just means you can drop into the cpan terminal and search for and install from the remote server.\n\nThe demo mentioned before had an \"install\" which would call npm to download a bunch of modules off the remote server.  If that code wanted to be packaged on Tizen then somebody would need to download all those same files ahead of time and put that in the actual demo source.\n\nok... with all that said, yes, it would be a cool thing for developers to be able to experiment with nodejs and use npm to download arbitrary modules (and there are a ton of them).  The only reason i didn\u0027t enabled this by default is because nodejs does some very evil things in install of the npm source requiring some trickery in the spec file.  If figured out this trickery so will go ahead and submit a second patchset"},{"timestamp":1373665833,"reviewer":{"name":"Rusty
