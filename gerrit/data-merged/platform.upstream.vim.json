Well here it is only set for the function independently of SMACK because there is no real smack include that define it (sys/smack.h isn\u0027t a kernel include and needs a specific include, the libsmack that doesn\u0027t define functions to handle labels of files) and frankly can you say if the limit is 255 or 256 because of the terminating zero that is not properly handled. (are the that extended attribute SMACK64EXEC and SMACK64MMAP  filtered? not sure...) Do you want to limit to 255? Who cares? vi doesn\u0027t set the labels but copies it. If the label were good it will remains good, and conversely, that is not the problem of vi. Then taking, presumably, enough size in the stack to handle labels is just good.\n\n - Errors aren\u0027t handled. Okay, but what to do with errors? emit a warning? okay. why not.
