But package\n\"ug-image-viewer-efl\" cannot be built for this architecture\nbecause of build errors of the following type:\n\nerror: cast from pointer to integer of different size\n\nerror: cast from \u0027void*\u0027 to \u0027int\u0027 loses precision\n\nThe reason that there are several casts from pointer type to type\n(int) in the current implementation of package. These casts\nare correct for 32-bit architectures, since on them both pointer\ntypes and (int) have the same size - 32 bits. But on 64-bit\narchitectures pointer types have size 64 bit and (int) has size\n32 bit, and cast from one to another can provide incorrect results.\n\nThis problem can be fixed just by simple replacement of (int)\nvariables with (size_t) variables, since it does not change the logic\nof code and provide additional compatibility with 64-bit\narchitectures. This fix does not affect external API functions,\nsince only types of local variables and prototypes of static\nfunctions are changed.\n\nAlso options \"-mfpu\u003dneon\" and \"-mfloat-abi\u003dsoftfp\" are not recognized\nby GCC if aarch64 is the target architecture. The replacements of\nthese options are \"simd\" and \"fp\" suffixes for option \"-march\".\n\nAlso execstack command does not work for aarch64 binaries, since\naarch64 support is not included to version of execstack used in\nTizen. That\u0027s why we have disabled this command just for the case of\naarch64.\n\nThe patch has been checked for build compatibility under armv7l, i586\nand aarch64 architectures and build results are available at\nhttps://build.tizen.org/package/show?package\u003dug-image-viewer-efl\u0026project\u003ddevel%3Aarm_toolchain%3AMobile%3AMain\n\nChange-Id: Ia476533b6b8c45ffb655db96e09d0c7ea2cde912\nSigned-off-by: Ilya Palachev \u003ci.palachev@samsung.com\u003e\n","createdOn":1397064109,"lastUpdated":1401366575,"sortKey":"002d682d00004b45","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1397064109,"reviewer":{"name":"Ilya Palachev","email":"i.palachev@samsung.com","username":"ipalachev"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 1."},{"timestamp":1397098203,"reviewer":{"name":"Sung-jae Park","email":"nicesj@nicesj.com","username":"nicesj"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2"},{"timestamp":1398762599,"reviewer":{"name":"Ilya Palachev","email":"i.palachev@samsung.com","username":"ipalachev"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Verified+1\n\nThe build was verfied both for aarch64, armv7l, i586.\n\nSee results here: https://build.tizen.org/project/monitor?project\u003ddevel%3Aarm_toolchain%3AMobile%3Atest"},{"timestamp":1401366575,"reviewer":{"name":"MyungJoo Ham","email":"myungjoo.ham@samsung.com","username":"mzx"},"message":"Change has been successfully merged into the git repository."}]}
