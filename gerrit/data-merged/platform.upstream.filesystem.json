This is expressing itself in an\nimage creation race where the web runtime will sometimes be installed\nwith a set of critical database files not created.\n\nSince the dbspace directory structure (with /opt/dbspace considered\nread-only to all but the preinstalled apps, and /opt/usr/dbspace used\nfor read-write access) is a fundamental part of the existing tizen\nmiddleware design, then the base filesystem package should be the\nthing creating and owning the directores.\n\nOnce the new multiuser design has landed then these directories will\nlikely no longer exist in a shared area.\n\nChange-Id: I0ad7e7f1b8a79a676ddaeb927a844afed9885d9d\nSigned-off-by: Rusty Lynch
