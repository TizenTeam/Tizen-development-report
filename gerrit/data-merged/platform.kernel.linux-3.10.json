This often includes:\n  - one side cannot overwrite data while the other reads it\n  - one side cannot shrink the buffer while the other accesses it\n  - one side cannot grow the buffer beyond previously set boundaries\n\nIf there is a trust-relationship between both parties, there is no need\nfor policy enforcement.  However, if there\u0027s no trust relationship (eg.,\nfor general-purpose IPC) sharing memory-regions is highly fragile and\noften not possible without local copies.  Look at the following two\nuse-cases:\n\n  1) A graphics client wants to share its rendering-buffer with a\n     graphics-server. The memory-region is allocated by the client for\n     read/write access and a second FD is passed to the server. While\n     scanning out from the memory region, the server has no guarantee that\n     the client doesn\u0027t shrink the buffer at any time, requiring rather\n     cumbersome SIGBUS handling.\n  2) A process wants to perform an RPC on another process. To avoid huge\n     bandwidth consumption, zero-copy is preferred. After a message is\n     assembled in-memory and a FD is passed to the remote side, both sides\n     want to be sure that neither modifies this shared copy, anymore. The\n     source may have put sensible data into the message without a separate\n     copy and the target may want to parse the message inline, to avoid a\n     local copy.\n\nWhile SIGBUS handling, POSIX mandatory locking and MAP_DENYWRITE provide\nways to achieve most of this, the first one is unproportionally ugly to\nuse in libraries and the latter two are broken/racy or even disabled due\nto denial of service attacks.\n\nThis patch introduces the concept of SEALING.  If you seal a file, a\nspecific set of operations is blocked on that file forever.  Unlike locks,\nseals can only be set, never removed.  Hence, once you verified a specific\nset of seals is set, you\u0027re guaranteed that no-one can perform the blocked\noperations on this file, anymore.\n\nAn initial set of SEALS is introduced by this patch:\n  - SHRINK: If SEAL_SHRINK is set, the file in question cannot be reduced\n            in size. This affects ftruncate() and open(O_TRUNC).\n  - GROW: If SEAL_GROW is set, the file in question cannot be increased\n          in size. This affects ftruncate(), fallocate() and write().\n  - WRITE: If SEAL_WRITE is set, no write operations (besides resizing)\n           are possible. This affects fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE), mmap() and\n           write().\n  - SEAL: If SEAL_SEAL is set, no further seals can be added to a file.\n          This basically prevents the F_ADD_SEAL operation on a file and\n          can be set to prevent others from adding further seals that you\n          don\u0027t want.\n\nThe described use-cases can easily use these seals to provide safe use\nwithout any trust-relationship:\n\n  1) The graphics server can verify that a passed file-descriptor has\n     SEAL_SHRINK set. This allows safe scanout, while the client is\n     allowed to increase buffer size for window-resizing on-the-fly.\n     Concurrent writes are explicitly allowed.\n  2) For general-purpose IPC, both processes can verify that SEAL_SHRINK,\n     SEAL_GROW and SEAL_WRITE are set. This guarantees that neither\n     process can modify the data while the other side parses it.\n     Furthermore, it guarantees that even with writable FDs passed to the\n     peer, it cannot increase the size to hit memory-limits of the source\n     process (in case the file-storage is accounted to the source).\n\nThe new API is an extension to fcntl(), adding two new commands:\n  F_GET_SEALS: Return a bitset describing the seals on the file. This\n               can be called on any FD if the underlying file supports\n               sealing.\n  F_ADD_SEALS: Change the seals of a given file. This requires WRITE\n               access to the file and F_SEAL_SEAL may not already be set.\n               Furthermore, the underlying file must support sealing and\n               there may not be any existing shared mapping of that file.\n               Otherwise, EBADF/EPERM is returned.\n               The given seals are _added_ to the existing set of seals\n               on the file. You cannot remove seals again.\n\nThe fcntl() handler is currently specific to shmem and disabled on all\nfiles. A file needs to explicitly support sealing for this interface to\nwork. A separate syscall is added in a follow-up, which creates files that\nsupport sealing. There is no intention to support this on other\nfile-systems. Semantics are unclear for non-volatile files and we lack any\nuse-case right now. Therefore, the implementation is specific to shmem.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Herrmann \u003cdh.herrmann@gmail.com\u003e\nAcked-by: Hugh Dickins \u003chughd@google.com\u003e\nCc: Michael Kerrisk \u003cmtk.manpages@gmail.com\u003e\nCc: Ryan Lortie \u003cdesrt@desrt.ca\u003e\nCc: Lennart Poettering \u003clennart@poettering.net\u003e\nCc: Daniel Mack \u003czonque@gmail.com\u003e\nCc: Andy Lutomirski \u003cluto@amacapital.net\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Morton \u003cakpm@linux-foundation.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds \u003ctorvalds@linux-foundation.org\u003e\n\nChange-Id: I58642ae2db7fef5d952b22beada3525526dd3a20\nOrigin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id\u003d40e041a2c858b3caefc757e26cb85bfceae5062b\nBackported-by: Maciej Wereski \u003cm.wereski@partner.samsung.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Maciej Wereski \u003cm.wereski@partner.samsung.com\u003e\n","createdOn":1419934108,"lastUpdated":1420427762,"sortKey":"0032412400008089","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1419934108,"reviewer":{"name":"Maciej Wereski","email":"m.wereski@partner.samsung.com","username":"mwereski"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 1."},{"timestamp":1419934181,"reviewer":{"name":"Maciej Wereski","email":"m.wereski@partner.samsung.com","username":"mwereski"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Verified+1"},{"timestamp":1420016534,"reviewer":{"name":"Lukasz Stelmach","email":"l.stelmach@samsung.com","username":"lstelmach"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1"},{"timestamp":1420194484,"reviewer":{"name":"Lukasz Skalski","email":"l.skalski@samsung.com","username":"lskalski"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1"},{"timestamp":1420427762,"reviewer":{"name":"Chanho Park","email":"chanho61.park@samsung.com","username":"cometzero"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 Verified+1"},{"timestamp":1420427762,"reviewer":{"name":"Chanho Park","email":"chanho61.park@samsung.com","username":"cometzero"},"message":"Change has been successfully merged into the git repository."}]}

McKenney for explaining this and for the\nfinal version that checks the context with CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP\u003dy\nfor all possible configurations.\n\nThe function can be empty in the CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU case,\nrcu_read_lock and rcu_read_unlock are not needed in this case\nbecause the task can be preempted on indication from scheduler.\nThanks to Peter Zijlstra for catching this and for his help\nin trying a solution that changes __might_sleep.\n\nInitial cond_resched_rcu_lock() function suggested by Eric Dumazet.\n\nTested-by: Julian Anastasov \u003cja@ssi.bg\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Julian Anastasov \u003cja@ssi.bg\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Simon Horman \u003chorms@verge.net.au\u003e\nAcked-by: Peter Zijlstra \u003cpeterz@infradead.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Pablo Neira Ayuso \u003cpablo@netfilter.org\u003e\n\nChange-Id: I5f36f86484198f9064725d424c3d91d5fac8e1d4\nOrigin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id\u003df6f3c437d09e2f62533034e67bfb4385191e992c\nBackported-by: Maciej Wereski \u003cm.wereski@partner.samsung.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Maciej Wereski \u003cm.wereski@partner.samsung.com\u003e\n","createdOn":1419934107,"lastUpdated":1420427755,"sortKey":"0032412300008086","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1419934107,"reviewer":{"name":"Maciej Wereski","email":"m.wereski@partner.samsung.com","username":"mwereski"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 1."},{"timestamp":1419934181,"reviewer":{"name":"Maciej Wereski","email":"m.wereski@partner.samsung.com","username":"mwereski"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Verified+1"},{"timestamp":1420016533,"reviewer":{"name":"Lukasz Stelmach","email":"l.stelmach@samsung.com","username":"lstelmach"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1"},{"timestamp":1420194640,"reviewer":{"name":"Lukasz Skalski","email":"l.skalski@samsung.com","username":"lskalski"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1"},{"timestamp":1420427754,"reviewer":{"name":"Chanho Park","email":"chanho61.park@samsung.com","username":"cometzero"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 Verified+1"},{"timestamp":1420427755,"reviewer":{"name":"Chanho Park","email":"chanho61.park@samsung.com","username":"cometzero"},"message":"Change has been successfully merged into the git repository."}]}

This patch makes cpu index\nusing cluster id and core id for the calculation of their register\naddress and the identification. But there is a problem to use cluster id\nfor core index creation. That is, cluster id does not start from 0 in\nold processors which do not have more than one cluster. For example,\nExynos4412\u0027s cluster id for its 4 core is 0xa.

This is usually\nnecessary to avoid visual glitches at the beginning of video data\ntransmission.\n\nSimilarly, the shutdown sequence is typically done in three steps as\nwell: a) disable the panel (e.g. turn off backlight), b) cease video\ndata transmission and c) power down the panel.\n\nCurrently drivers can only implement .enable() and .disable() functions,\nwhich is not enough to implement the above sequences. This commit adds a\nsecond pair of functions, .prepare() and .unprepare() to allow more\nfine-grained control over when the above steps are performed.\n\nChange-Id: Id00eec6fd18b9e480975e0c3478a8890cacb79e7\nSigned-off-by: Ajay Kumar \u003cajaykumar.rs@samsung.com\u003e\n[treding: rewrite changelog, add kerneldoc]\nSigned-off-by: Thierry Reding \u003ctreding@nvidia.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: YoungJun Cho \u003cyj44.cho@samsung.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Inki Dae \u003cinki.dae@samsung.com\u003e\n","createdOn":1414134522,"lastUpdated":1414134546,"sortKey":"0030a76d00007287","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1414134522,"reviewer":{"name":"Inki Dae","email":"inki.dae@samsung.com","username":"daeinki"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 1."},{"timestamp":1414134544,"reviewer":{"name":"Inki Dae","email":"inki.dae@samsung.com","username":"daeinki"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 Verified+1"},{"timestamp":1414134546,"reviewer":{"name":"Inki Dae","email":"inki.dae@samsung.com","username":"daeinki"},"message":"Change has been successfully merged into the git repository."}]}

This can cause problems if the\narchitected timer driver has already been initialized because the kernel\nwill think that the counter has wrapped around, causing a big jump in\nprintk timestamps and delaying any scheduled clock events until the\ncounter reaches the value it had before it was reset.\n\nThe kernel code makes no assumptions about the initial value of the mct\ncounter so there is no reason from a software perspective to clear the\ncounter before starting it.

the tuner is pulled out, then dvb_usbv2_disconnect is called.\n\nIn such case, it will first call dvb_usbv2_adapter_frontend_exit to stop\ndvb_frontend_thread, and then call dvb_usbv2_adapter_dvb_exit to clear\nADAP_STREAMING bit.\n\nAt this point, if dvb_frontend_thread is sleeping and waiting for\nADAP_STREAMING to be cleared to get out of sleep. then\ndvb_frontend_thread can never be stoped,

Probably, users in the mobile,\nembedded area (e.g. Android based) with different security policy\nrequirements for application groups could have great benefit from\nthat as well. For example, with a little bit of configuration effort,\nan admin could whitelist well-known applications, and thus block\notherwise unwanted \"hard-to-track\" applications like [1] from a\nuser\u0027s machine. Blocking is just one example, but it is not limited\nto that, meaning we can have much different scenarios/policies that\nnetfilter allows us than just blocking, e.g. fine grained settings\nwhere applications are allowed to connect/send traffic to, application\ntraffic marking/conntracking, application-specific packet mangling,\nand so on.\n\nImplementation of PID-based matching would not be appropriate\nas they frequently change, and child tracking would make that\neven more complex and ugly. Cgroups would be a perfect candidate\nfor accomplishing that as they associate a set of tasks with a\nset of parameters for one or more subsystems, in our case the\nnetfilter subsystem, which, of course, can be combined with other\ncgroup subsystems into something more complex if needed.\n\nAs mentioned, to overcome this constraint, such processes could\nbe placed into one or multiple cgroups where different fine-grained\nrules can be defined depending on the application scenario, while\ne.g. everything else that is not part of that could be dropped (or\nvice versa), thus making life harder for unwanted processes to\ncommunicate to the outside world. So, we make use of cgroups here\nto track jobs and limit their resources in terms of iptables\npolicies; in other words, limiting, tracking, etc what they are\nallowed to communicate.\n\nIn our case we\u0027re working on outgoing traffic based on which local\nsocket that originated from. Also, one doesn\u0027t even need to have\nan a-prio knowledge of the application internals regarding their\nparticular use of ports or protocols. Matching is *extremly*\nlightweight as we just test for the sk_classid marker of sockets,\noriginating from net_cls. net_cls and netfilter do not contradict\neach other; in fact, each construct can live as standalone or they\ncan be used in combination with each other, which is perfectly fine,\nplus it serves Tejun\u0027s requirement to not introduce a new cgroups\nsubsystem. Through this, we result in a very minimal and efficient\nmodule, and don\u0027t add anything except netfilter code.\n\nOne possible, minimal usage example (many other iptables options\ncan be applied obviously):\n\n 1) Configuring cgroups if not already done, e.g.:\n\n  mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls\n  mount -t cgroup -o net_cls net_cls /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls\n  mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls/0\n  echo 1 \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls/0/net_cls.classid\n  (resp. a real flow handle id for tc)\n\n 2) Configuring netfilter (iptables-nftables), e.g.:\n\n  iptables -A OUTPUT -m cgroup ! --cgroup 1 -j DROP\n\n 3) Running applications, e.g.:\n\n  ping 208.67.222.222  \u003cpid:1799\u003e\n  echo 1799 \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls/0/tasks\n  64 bytes from 208.67.222.222: icmp_seq\u003d44 ttl\u003d49 time\u003d11.9 ms\n  [...]\n  ping 208.67.220.220  \u003cpid:1804\u003e\n  ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted\n  [...]\n  echo 1804 \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls/0/tasks\n  64 bytes from 208.67.220.220: icmp_seq\u003d89 ttl\u003d56 time\u003d19.0 ms\n  [...]\n\nOf course, real-world deployments would make use of cgroups user\nspace toolsuite, or own custom policy daemons dynamically moving\napplications from/to various cgroups.\n\n  [1] http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-06/bh-eu-06-biondi/bh-eu-06-biondi-up.pdf\n\nSigned-off-by: Daniel Borkmann \u003cdborkman@redhat.com\u003e\nCc: Tejun Heo \u003ctj@kernel.org\u003e\nCc: cgroups@vger.kernel.org\nAcked-by: Li Zefan \u003clizefan@huawei.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Pablo Neira Ayuso \u003cpablo@netfilter.org\u003e\n[backport from upstream commit 82a37132f300ea53bdcd812917af5a6329ec80c3]\nSigned-off-by: Przemyslaw Kedzierski \u003cp.kedzierski@samsung.com\u003e\nChange-Id: Iac82ecef5b31a50f52ad9329bdd0403c667f154d\n","createdOn":1401374877,"lastUpdated":1402881853,"sortKey":"002dcad4000056a7","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1401374877,"reviewer":{"name":"Przemyslaw Kedzierski","username":"pkedzierski"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 1."},{"timestamp":1402658410,"reviewer":{"name":"Karol Lewandowski","email":"k.lewandowsk@samsung.com","username":"klewandowski"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1\n\nThis is a backport from mainline commit 82a37132f300ea53bdcd812917af5a6329ec80c3 (available in v3.14-rc1 and newer kernels)."},{"timestamp":1402663706,"reviewer":{"name":"Sylwester Nawrocki","email":"s.nawrocki@samsung.com","username":"snawrocki"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\nCan someone confirm it\u0027s verified with our base ?"},{"timestamp":1402881545,"reviewer":{"name":"Chanho Park","email":"chanho61.park@samsung.com","username":"cometzero"},"message":"Patch Set 2: Patch Set 1 was rebased"},{"timestamp":1402881853,"reviewer":{"name":"Chanho Park","email":"chanho61.park@samsung.com","username":"cometzero"},"message":"Patch Set 2: Verified+1 Code-Review+2"},{"timestamp":1402881853,"reviewer":{"name":"Chanho Park","email":"chanho61.park@samsung.com","username":"cometzero"},"message":"Change has been successfully merged into the git repository."}]}
