This was \"simulating\" a mouse up event when\nthe surface move or resize finished.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u0027t work for touch-based move. The pointer enter isn\u0027t\nemitted, because the wl_touch interface doesn\u0027t have the concept of a\npointer.\n\nChanging this code to make it more similar to what Weston\u0027s toytoolkit\ndoes, the mouse up event is sent as soon as the move or resize grab\nstarts.
