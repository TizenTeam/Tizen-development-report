When disabled, such incoming items are\nsilently discarded. This follows the approach already taken for\nvbookmark items.\n\nThe enabled/disabled check in CMake only looks at availability of the\n.pc files. The .spec file then makes the .pc files available only when\ndesired. This is a bit error prone because something might pull them\nin indirectly. However, that itself would be a bug and thus this\nsimple approach of extending CMake rules was used.\n\nOnly the mobile profile uses these services. Instead of checking for\nthe profile, a package or system bcond would be better. But that needs\nto be fixed across multiple packages consistently and thus is not done\nas part of this commit here.\n\nChange-Id: I4eef2ab9cb20b9721becac5ea5989c74c183ab22\nSigned-off-by: Patrick Ohly \u003cpatrick.ohly@intel.com\u003e\n","createdOn":1415795969,"lastUpdated":1417399027,"sortKey":"00317bf5000075e7","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1415795969,"reviewer":{"name":"Patrick Ohly","email":"patrick.ohly@intel.com","username":"pohly"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 1."},{"timestamp":1415796261,"reviewer":{"name":"Patrick Ohly","email":"patrick.ohly@intel.com","username":"pohly"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Verified+1\n\nI compiled on IVI and verified that with this change, calendar and contact service can be uninstalled from the image.\n\nSending vcards somehow also failed before the change (my phone reported \"file not sent\").
