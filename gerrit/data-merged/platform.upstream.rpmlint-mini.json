somebody wants it to be located in another) were obtained by us in HUGE number of packages because of interesting (~random) behaviour of autotools installation process :)\n\nThat\u0027s why we decided to avoid this problem not by fixing tons (!) of build scripts written on m4, but by creating symlinks at the level of filesystem (see the chnage for package \"filesystem\"): /lib -\u003e /usr/lib,
