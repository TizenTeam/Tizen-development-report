This should be\nported by someone who has such hardware, and also in a clean way now that\nGStreamer since 1.0 has features to handle all this properly.\n\nThere\u0027s still a lot of potential to clean things up and fix many bugs, and also\nto implement zerocopy rendering. But those are for later if there\u0027s actual\ninterest in this at all.\n\nCommits:\n\n- Update configure checks and ecore example to GStreamer 1.0\n- Initial port of emotion to GStreamer 1.0\n- Samsung specific code commented out, should be ported by someone\nwith the hardware.\n- Return GST_FLOW_FLUSHING when the sink is unlocked\n- Remove unused GSignal from the sink\n- Use GstVideoInfo to store the format details inside the sink\n- Add support for pixel-aspect-ratio\n- Store video format information in GstVideoInfo for the different video streams\n- Use GstAudioInfo to store the audio format information\n- Remove some unused defines\n- Header cleanup\n- Implement initial support for GstNavigation interface\n- Implement setting of audio/video channel\n\nReviewers: cedric\n\nCC: cedric\n\nDifferential Revision: https://phab.enlightenment.org/D387\n\nSigned-off-by: Cedric BAIL \u003ccedric.bail@samsung.com\u003e\n\nOrigin: http://git.enlightenment.org/core/efl.git/commit/?id\u003d9c752106f75c9a6415971cd965eedaf3d15fedc6\nBug-Tizen: TIVI-2578/part (Enable to build newest EFL 1.8 on IVI)\nBug-Tizen: PTREL-626/part (efl should support gstreamer 1.0)\nChange-Id: Ibc21f9a2891551402f6dd2d5eb7435691bdf3115\nSigned-off-by: Philippe Coval \u003cphilippe.coval@open.eurogiciel.org\u003e\n","createdOn":1389980188,"lastUpdated":1392755218,"sortKey":"002b378a00003bb2","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1389980188,"reviewer":{"name":"Philippe Coval","email":"philippe.coval@open.eurogiciel.org","username":"pcoval"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 1."},{"timestamp":1390210514,"reviewer":{"name":"Philippe Coval","email":"philippe.coval@open.eurogiciel.org","username":"pcoval"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Verified+1"},{"timestamp":1390210902,"reviewer":{"name":"Manuel Bachmann","email":"manuel.bachmann@open.eurogiciel.org","username":"mbachmann"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Verified+1 Code-Review+1"},{"timestamp":1390319765,"reviewer":{"name":"Philippe Coval","email":"philippe.coval@open.eurogiciel.org","username":"pcoval"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 2."},{"timestamp":1390412129,"reviewer":{"name":"Philippe Coval","email":"philippe.coval@open.eurogiciel.org","username":"pcoval"},"message":"Patch Set 2: Verified+1"},{"timestamp":1391596818,"reviewer":{"name":"ronan(Eurogiciel) Le Martret","email":"ronan.lemartret@open.eurogiciel.org","username":"ronan"},"message":"Patch Set 2: Verified+1 Code-Review+2"},{"timestamp":1391696577,"reviewer":{"name":"Philippe Coval","email":"philippe.coval@open.eurogiciel.org","username":"pcoval"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 3."},{"timestamp":1391769326,"reviewer":{"name":"Philippe Coval","email":"philippe.coval@open.eurogiciel.org","username":"pcoval"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 4."},{"timestamp":1391769487,"reviewer":{"name":"Philippe Coval","email":"philippe.coval@open.eurogiciel.org","username":"pcoval"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 5."},{"timestamp":1392110647,"reviewer":{"name":"Kévin THIERRY","email":"kevin.thierry@eurogiciel.fr","username":"kthierry"},"message":"Patch Set 5: Code-Review+1"},{"timestamp":1392659017,"reviewer":{"name":"Rafael Antognolli","email":"rafael.antognolli@intel.com","username":"antognolli"},"message":"Patch Set 5: Code-Review+2\n\nAlready reviewed upstream."},{"timestamp":1392746971,"reviewer":{"name":"Philippe Coval","email":"philippe.coval@open.eurogiciel.org","username":"pcoval"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 6."},{"timestamp":1392755190,"reviewer":{"name":"Rafael Antognolli","email":"rafael.antognolli@intel.com","username":"antognolli"},"message":"Patch Set 6: Verified+1 Code-Review+2"}]}
