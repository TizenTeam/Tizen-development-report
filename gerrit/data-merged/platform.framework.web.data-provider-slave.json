But package\n\"org.tizen.data-provider-slave\" cannot be built for this architecture\nbecause of the following build error:\n\nerror: cast from pointer to integer of different size\n\nThe reason that there is cast from type (int*) to type (int) in the\ncurrent implementation of function util_get_current_module. This cast\nis correct for 32-bit architectures, since on them both (int*) and\n(int) have the same size - 32 bits. But on 64-bit architectures\n(int*) has size 64 bit and (int) has size 32 bit, and cast from one\nto another can provide incorrect results.\n\nThis problem can be fixed just by simple replacement of (int)\nvariables with (size_t) variables, since it does not change the logic\nof code and provide additional compatibility with 64-bit\narchitectures. This fix does not affect other functions, since only\ntypes of local variables are changed.\n\nThe patch has been checked for build compatibility under armv7l, i586\nand aarch64 architectures and build results are available at\nhttps://build.tizen.org/package/show?package\u003dorg.tizen.data-provider-slave\u0026project\u003ddevel%3Aarm_toolchain%3AMobile%3AMain\n\nChange-Id: I21c47349f7d41f5b10a33f3772775cc208a43f75\nSigned-off-by: Ilya Palachev \u003ci.palachev@samsung.com\u003e\n","createdOn":1397052001,"lastUpdated":1397475901,"sortKey":"002c6ae100004b42","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1397052001,"reviewer":{"name":"Ilya Palachev","email":"i.palachev@samsung.com","username":"ipalachev"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 1."},{"timestamp":1397054754,"reviewer":{"name":"Sung-jae Park","email":"nicesj@nicesj.com","username":"nicesj"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2\n\nIs there any binary or emulator to verify this?\nIf there is a way to veify this, I will verify not only this but also the other packages which have dependency to this."},{"timestamp":1397120766,"reviewer":{"name":"Ilya Palachev","email":"i.palachev@samsung.com","username":"ipalachev"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\nThe qemu emulator for aarch64 is available at https://build.tizen.org/package/show?package\u003dqemu-accel-aarch64\u0026project\u003ddevel%3Aarm_toolchain%3AMobile%3ABase \n\nIf you want to use it, you need to create build chroot for the package data-provider-slave and run test in it.
