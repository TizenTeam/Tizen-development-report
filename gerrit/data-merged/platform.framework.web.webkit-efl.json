On X platform, it\u0027s naturally implemented by the\nglobal PIXMAP ID. On the other hand, it becomes different under Wayland.\nIt uses an EGL window buffer, which is indeed a double buffer. Each time\nit  calls eglSwapBuffer, the UIProcess can get the correct buffer to be\nused for the rest compositing.\n\nHowever, it causes the following problem:\n1. All canvases are created from EGL surfaces. The type of\nthose surfaces can\u0027t be treated as a source to render to other surface.\nSo it is very expensive (more than 10x slow) when we copy one canvas to\nanother.\n\n2. Sometimes, for a static canvas, we only paint once in the WebProcess\n, but may share it with the UIProcess several times.\nThen, when we call eglSwapBuffers at the even time, we just pass the\nwrong buffer to the UIProcess.\n\nThe ideal solution is to find another clean way to share buffers\non wayland platform rather than use this way. Before that, this\npatch implemented a trade off solution to fix the above problem\npartly, because it uses two cairo gl surface to represent one canvas:\nthe first is a pure gl surface for texture and the second is an EGL gl\nsurface. We do all canvas related painting on the first gl\nsurface thus we can avoid the first problem. And then, every time\nwe need to share the canvas to the UIProcess, we leverage cairo\nto paint the first gl surface to the second EGL gl surface,\nthus we always pass the correct content to the UIProcess. The side\neffect is that we introduce one more copy and we use the required\ngpu memory two times. The one more copy is not expensive, because\nwe do it on GPU side.\n\nThis solution could just solve the problem partly. As one big assumption\nof this solution is that the WebProcess never use the rendering result\nfrom the UIProcess.\n\nAfter this patch, GUIMARK3 cache version and Penguin works fine.\n\nChange-Id: Ie4b49e7190f241669332d296ab831a773df5ad1a\nSigned-off-by: Zhigang Gong \u003czhigang.gong@intel.com\u003e\n","createdOn":1384999895,"lastUpdated":1385020209,"sortKey":"00293ff600003170","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1385002606,"reviewer":{"name":"Robot Tizen","username":"tizenrobot"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\n[BUILD CHECK RESULT] This change is built against OBS project devel:ivi: \n\n repository     arch           result         \n\n standard       i586           succeeded"},{"timestamp":1385002772,"reviewer":{"name":"Robot Tizen","username":"tizenrobot"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\n[BUILD CHECK RESULT] This change is built against OBS project Tizen:IVI: \n\n repository     arch           result         \n\n standard       i586           succeeded"},{"timestamp":1385003112,"reviewer":{"name":"Gyuyoung Kim","email":"gyuyoung.kim@webkit.org","username":"gyuyoung2"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\n(1 comment)"},{"timestamp":1385003564,"reviewer":{"name":"Zhigang Gong","email":"zhigang.gong@intel.com","username":"zhigang"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\n(1 comment)"},{"timestamp":1385011489,"reviewer":{"name":"Joone Hur","email":"joone.hur@intel.com","username":"joone"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\n(4 comments)"},{"timestamp":1385012620,"reviewer":{"name":"Zhigang Gong","email":"zhigang.gong@intel.com","username":"zhigang"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\nJoone,\n\nthanks for pointing out those typos, and please help to update the patch.

On X platform, it\u0027s naturly implmenented by the\nglobal PIXMAP ID. On wayland, it become different. It uses a window\nbuffer, which is indeed a double buffer. Each time it calls eglSwapBuffer,\nthe browser process can get the correct buffer to be used for the rest\ncompositing.\n\nThen it causes the following problem:\n1. The canvases are all created from egl surface. And that type of\nsurface can\u0027t be treated a source to render to other surface. So it\nis very expensive (more than 10x slow) when we copy one canvas to\nanother.\n\n2. Some times, for a static canvas, we only paint once at webprocess\nside but may share it to browser process several time. Then at the even\ntime when we call eglSwapBuffers, we just pass the wrong buffer to browser\nprocess.\n\nThe ideal solution is to find another clean way to share buffers\non wayland platform rather than use this style. Before that, this\npatch implemented a trade off solution to fix the above problem\npartly. This patch uses two cairo gl surface to represent one canvas,\nthe first is a pure textured gl surface and the second is a egl gl\nsurface. We do all canvas related paiting on the first textured gl\nsurface thus we can avoid the first problem. And latter, every time\nwe need to share the canvas to browser process, we leverage cairo\nto paint the first textured gl surface to the second egl gl surface,\nthus we always pass the correct content to browser process. The side\neffect is we introduce one more copy and we use two times of the required\ngpu memory. The one more copy is not expensive, because we do it on\nGPU side.\n\nI mentioned that this solution just solve the problem partly. As one\nbig assumption of this solution is that the webprocess never use the\nrendering result from the browser process.\n\nThis assumption is not always correct. Some canvas compositing is done\nin browser process and latter, it may become a source to paint to another\ncanvas. Then this solution will be broken.\n\nBut anyway, this is still much better than previous implemention.\n\nAfter this patch, GUIMARK3 cache version and Penguin works fine.\n\nChange-Id: Ie4b49e7190f241669332d296ab831a773df5ad1a\nSigned-off-by: Zhigang Gong \u003czhigang.gong@intel.com\u003e\n","createdOn":1381919089,"lastUpdated":1382023463,"sortKey":"00287cdc00002b0a","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1381936568,"reviewer":{"name":"kalyan kondapally","email":"kalyan.kondapally@intel.com","username":"kalyan"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\nFor 2"},{"timestamp":1381936797,"reviewer":{"name":"kalyan kondapally","email":"kalyan.kondapally@intel.com","username":"kalyan"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\nFor 2: I believe the real issue is to figure out why Webkit swaps even when the content of the layer hasn\u0027t changed.
