Added spec-file qemu-accel-aarch64.spec for Aarch64 architecture\nof qemu-accel. It\u0027s based on modified file qemu-accel-armv7l.spec.\n\n2. Added support of adding new cross utilities using separate macros,\ninstead of hardcoded list of binaries that is hard to maintain. So\nnow it\u0027s possible to add/remove groups of binaries using macros.\n(only in qemu-accel-aarch64.spec)\n\n3. Added optional switch between native and cross-accelerated binfmt\nmode using macro \"use_binfmt_binary\". Depending on its value the file\nbaselibs.conf is modified so that to turn on native or cross binfmt\nmode (binary qemu-aarch64 provides native mode, qemu-aarch64-binfmt\nprovides cross-accelerated mode).\n(only in qemu-accel-aarch64.spec)\n\n4. Added macros \"gcc_version\" and \"gcc_version_dot\" to control gcc\nversion through macros (currently they are set directly by hardcoded\nversion numbers).\n(in qemu-accel-aarch64.spec and qemu-accel-armv7l.spec)\n\n5. Added post-install script for qemu-accel-aarch64 package in\nbaselibs.conf file.\n\n6. Generation of redundant packages \"qemu-accel-armv7l-*.aarch64.rpm\"\nand \"qemu-accel-aarch64-*.armv7l.rpm\" is avoided by commands\n\"targettype ... block!\" in file baselibs.conf.\n\n7. Added wrapper script also for /usr/bin/g++ (currently there is a\nwrapper script only for /usr/bin/gcc). This wrapper runs native\ncompiler instead of cross one in case when environment variable\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH is set. This is done because \"If LIBRARY_PATH is set,\nnative gcc adds the contents to its library search list, but cross\ngcc does not. So switch to all native in these situations\".\n(in qemu-accel-aarch64.spec and qemu-accel-armv7l.spec)\n\n8. Added two options \"-B\" for each call of cross compiler (gcc or\ng++) using existing wrapper script. This is done because in current\nconfiguration of toolchain directories compiler fails to find\nbinutils executables. Options \"-B\" set direct paths to these\ndirectories.\n(in qemu-accel-aarch64.spec and qemu-accel-armv7l.spec)\n\n9. Run native linker (/usr/bin/ld) in case when cross-accelerated\nlinker fails. This is the only way to build current version of gcc,\nbecause otherwise the build fails with following error:\n\nld: ./gcc/liblto_plugin.so: error loading plugin:\n    ./gcc/liblto_plugin.so: cannot open shared object file:\n    No such file or directory\n\nThis happens because cross ld cannot use native module\nliblto_plugin.so generated during the build of gcc. (It is done in\npost-install script in baselibs.conf both for aarch64 and armv7l)\n\n10. Created symlinks to files needed by native ld for the case when\nwe want to use it instead of cross-accelerated ld (crtbegin.o,\ncrtbeginS.o, crtbeginT.o, crtend.o, crtendS.o). (It is done in\npost-install script in baselibs.conf both for aarch64 and armv7l)\n\n11. Cutted off extra path (/emul/...) in the case when we want to use\nnative ld instead of cross-accelerated ld. It is done in post-install\nscript in baselibs.conf.\n\nChange-Id: I294bc231b511c95a78cc58bcb441ac9ed56c4069\nSigned-off-by: Ilya Palachev \u003ci.palachev@samsung.com\u003e\n","createdOn":1407152379,"lastUpdated":1407846901,"sortKey":"002f0e1300006319","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1407152379,"reviewer":{"name":"Ilya Palachev","email":"i.palachev@samsung.com","username":"ipalachev"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 1."},{"timestamp":1407152836,"reviewer":{"name":"Ilya Palachev","email":"i.palachev@samsung.com","username":"ipalachev"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\n(1 comment)"},{"timestamp":1407153073,"reviewer":{"name":"Ilya Palachev","email":"i.palachev@samsung.com","username":"ipalachev"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 2."},{"timestamp":1407153497,"reviewer":{"name":"Ilya Palachev","email":"i.palachev@samsung.com","username":"ipalachev"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 3."},{"timestamp":1407154494,"reviewer":{"name":"Ilya Palachev","email":"i.palachev@samsung.com","username":"ipalachev"},"message":"Patch Set 3:\n\nThe following project is built using the sources of this gerrit change:\n\nhttps://build.tizen.org/project/show?project\u003ddevel%3Aarm_toolchain%3AMobile%3ABase"},{"timestamp":1407154703,"reviewer":{"name":"Ilya Palachev","email":"i.palachev@samsung.com","username":"ipalachev"},"message":"Patch Set 3:\n\nUsually (in other packages) we push our changes to branch \"toolchain_upgrade\".
