Even though it is a write operation\na process can set a read lock on files which it has open\nonly for read access. Two programs with read access to\na file can use read locks to communicate.\n\nThis is not acceptable in a Mandatory Access Control\nenvironment. Smack treats setting a read lock as the\nwrite operation that it is. Unfortunately, many programs\nassume that setting a read lock is a read operation.\nThese programs are unhappy in the Smack environment.\n\nThis patch introduces a new access mode (lock) to address\nthis problem. A process with lock access to a file can\nset a read lock. A process with write access to a file can\nset a read lock or a write lock. This prevents a situation\nwhere processes are granted write access just so they can\nset read locks.\n\nTargeted for git://git.gitorious.org/smack-next/kernel.git\n\nChange-Id: I22ca438a655ff9f72055ae6278a88acd71904822\nSigned-off-by: Casey Schaufler \u003ccasey@schaufler-ca.com\u003e\n","createdOn":1384166422,"lastUpdated":1384780593,"sortKey":"0029305c00002ef9","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1384175180,"reviewer":{"name":"hkrogeru","email":"heikki.krogerus@linux.intel.com","username":"hkrogeru"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1\n\nCould you rebase this on top of the latest.\n\nThanks."},{"timestamp":1384176196,"reviewer":{"name":"Elena Reshetova","email":"elena.reshetova@intel.com","username":"elena"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 2."},{"timestamp":1384176883,"reviewer":{"name":"Robot Tizen","username":"tizenrobot"},"message":"Patch Set 2:\n\n[BUILD CHECK RESULT] This change is built against OBS project Tizen:Mobile: \n\n repository     arch           result         \n\n emulator       i586           succeeded"},{"timestamp":1384179423,"reviewer":{"name":"hkrogeru","email":"heikki.krogerus@linux.intel.com","username":"hkrogeru"},"message":"Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2"},{"timestamp":1384291434,"reviewer":{"name":"Casey Schaufler","email":"casey.schaufler@intel.com","username":"cschaufler"},"message":"Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2\n\nRequired change for Tizen3"},{"timestamp":1384329976,"reviewer":{"name":"hkrogeru","email":"heikki.krogerus@linux.intel.com","username":"hkrogeru"},"message":"Patch Set 2: Verified+1"},{"timestamp":1384329976,"reviewer":{"name":"hkrogeru","email":"heikki.krogerus@linux.intel.com","username":"hkrogeru"},"message":"Change has been successfully merged into the git repository."},{"timestamp":1384780593,"reviewer":{"name":"Robot Tizen","username":"tizenrobot"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\n[BUILD CHECK RESULT] This change is built against OBS project Tizen:Mobile: \n\n repository     arch           result         \n\n atom           i586           succeeded"}]}
