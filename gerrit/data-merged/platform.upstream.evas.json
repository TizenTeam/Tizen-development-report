However, they support a different set of features. Some\nof them, like subsurface clipping and scaling, might be added in the\nfuture, but so far we must work with what we have.\n\nThis commit allows to set an enum bitfield to the Video_Surface, with\nthe default value being one that will keep the same behavior as before,\nfor Ecore_X window. Thus, backward compatibility should not be broken.\n\nIt\u0027s possible to inform Evas that the surface in question is not able to\nresize or scale, or that it\u0027s above or below the original canvas\nsurface. This allows Evas to show the surface itself, or use a buffer of\npixels instead, when the capabilities are not available.\n\nChange-Id: I35764b72c31792e8af8c8d83a3f4694a1ae5fa87\n","createdOn":1381521559,"lastUpdated":1384591875,"sortKey":"0029241300002a20","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1381741761,"reviewer":{"name":"Wang Quanxian","email":"quanxian.wang@intel.com","username":"quanxianwang"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1"},{"timestamp":1382021578,"reviewer":{"name":"Eduardo Lima","email":"eblima@gmail.com","username":"etrunko"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Verified+1 Code-Review+1\n\nTested on the tizen_20131011.2_ivi-release image"},{"timestamp":1382021784,"reviewer":{"name":"Rafael Antognolli","email":"rafael.antognolli@intel.com","username":"antognolli"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2"},{"timestamp":1382021901,"reviewer":{"name":"Rafael Antognolli","email":"rafael.antognolli@intel.com","username":"antognolli"},"message":"Change has been successfully merged into the git repository."},{"timestamp":1382023570,"reviewer":{"name":"Robot Tizen","username":"tizenrobot"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\nA SR (Submit Request) has been triggered to submit the commit to OBS Tizen:Mobile project.\n- Submitter: Rafael Antognolli \u003crafael.antognolli@intel.com\u003e\n- Comments: Add video surface capabilities to Evas.\n- Git project: platform/upstream/evas\n- Tag: submit/tizen/20131017.152452\n- Commit: 89d19f48a65082120fbe0e26b21a6cacdc47e161 evas/image: Add video surface caps.\n- Request URL: https://build.tizen.org/request/show/16197"},{"timestamp":1382023580,"reviewer":{"name":"Robot Tizen","username":"tizenrobot"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\nA SR (Submit Request) has been triggered to submit the commit to OBS Tizen:IVI project.\n- Submitter: Rafael Antognolli \u003crafael.antognolli@intel.com\u003e\n- Comments: Add video surface capabilities to Evas.\n- Git project: platform/upstream/evas\n- Tag: submit/tizen/20131017.152452\n- Commit: 89d19f48a65082120fbe0e26b21a6cacdc47e161 evas/image: Add video surface caps.\n- Request URL: https://build.tizen.org/request/show/16198"},{"timestamp":1382023590,"reviewer":{"name":"Robot Tizen","username":"tizenrobot"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\nA SR (Submit Request) has been triggered to submit the commit to OBS Tizen:IVI:Release project.\n- Submitter: Rafael Antognolli \u003crafael.antognolli@intel.com\u003e\n- Comments: Add video surface capabilities to Evas.\n- Git project: platform/upstream/evas\n- Tag: submit/tizen/20131017.152452\n- Commit: 89d19f48a65082120fbe0e26b21a6cacdc47e161 evas/image: Add video surface caps.\n- Request URL: https://build.tizen.org/request/show/16199"},{"timestamp":1384221367,"reviewer":{"name":"Robot Tizen","username":"tizenrobot"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\nThe SR (Submit Request) has been accepted to OBS Tizen:IVI:Release project.\n- Package: evas\n- Reviewer: tgraydon\n- Comments: ok\n- Git project: platform/upstream/evas\n- Tag:submit/tizen/20131017.152452\n- Commit: 89d19f48a65082120fbe0e26b21a6cacdc47e161 evas/image: Add video surface caps.\n- Request URL:https://build.tizen.org/request/show/16199"},{"timestamp":1384591492,"reviewer":{"name":"Robot Tizen","username":"tizenrobot"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\nA SR (Submit Request) has been triggered to submit the commit to OBS Tizen:IVI:Stable project.\n- Submitter: Graydon, Tracy \u003ctracy.graydon@intel.com\u003e\n- Comments: submit/tizen_ivi_stable/20131116.083934\n- Git project: platform/upstream/evas\n- Tag: submit/tizen_ivi_stable/20131116.083934\n- Commit: 89d19f48a65082120fbe0e26b21a6cacdc47e161 evas/image: Add video surface caps.\n- Request URL: https://build.tizen.org/request/show/17278"},{"timestamp":1384591875,"reviewer":{"name":"Robot Tizen","username":"tizenrobot"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\nThe SR (Submit Request) has been accepted to OBS Tizen:IVI:Stable project.\n- Package: evas\n- Reviewer: tgraydon\n- Comments: Initial population of Tizen:IVI:Stable\n- Git project: platform/upstream/evas\n- Tag:submit/tizen_ivi_stable/20131116.083934\n- Commit: 89d19f48a65082120fbe0e26b21a6cacdc47e161 evas/image: Add video surface caps.\n- Request URL:https://build.tizen.org/request/show/17278"}]}
