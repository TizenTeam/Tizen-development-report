Bisecting\nshowed that the following kernel patch causes the breakage:\n    \"3edaf3e mac80211: manage AP netdev carrier state\".\n\nRunning connman with debugging enabled showed that in case of 3.4\nwe have the following sequence of RTM_NEWLINK events from the kernel:\n\n1. IFF_UP not set, ifi_change\u003d1\n2. IFF_UP,IFF_LOWER_UP, ifi_change\u003d1\n\nwhich makes connman do the following:\n\nconnmand[210]: plugins/wifi.c:wifi_newlink() index 4 flags 4098 change 1\nconnmand[210]: plugins/wifi.c:wifi_newlink() interface down\nconnmand[210]: plugins/wifi.c:wifi_newlink() index 4 flags 69635 change 1\nconnmand[210]: plugins/wifi.c:wifi_newlink() interface up\nconnmand[210]: plugins/wifi.c:wifi_newlink() carrier on\nconnmand[210]: plugins/wifi.c:handle_tethering() index 4 bridge tether\n\nHowever, in 3.5 we have the following sequents of events from the kernel:\n\n1. IFF_UP, ifi_change\u003d1\n2. IFF_UP,IFF_LOWER_UP, ifi_change\u003d0\n\nwhich makes connman do the following:\n\nconnmand[493]: plugins/wifi.c:wifi_newlink() index 4 flags 4099 change 1\nconnmand[493]: plugins/wifi.c:wifi_newlink() interface up\nconnmand[493]: plugins/wifi.c:wifi_newlink() index 4 flags 69635 change 0\n\nThe root-cause for it is that connman handles the \"ifi_change\" flag\nincorrectly. Connman interprets it as \"if non-zero, there was some change\",\nwhich is wrong. According to RFC 3549, it is \"reserved for future use.\nMust be set to 0xFFFFFFFF\". Thus, just remove that check, which makes\ntethering work.\n","createdOn":1366363834,"lastUpdated":1366403134,"sortKey":"002483e900000d22","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1366363845,"reviewer":{"name":"Robot Tizen","username":"tizenrobot"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\nrpmlint checked packaging/connman.spec: 0 errors, 2 warnings.\n- line 7: W: non-standard-group System/Networking\n- line 60: W: mixed-use-of-spaces-and-tabs (spaces: line 1, tab: line 60)"},{"timestamp":1366403113,"reviewer":{"name":"Tracy Graydon","email":"tracy.graydon@intel.com","username":"tgraydon"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved\n\n"},{"timestamp":1366403134,"reviewer":{"name":"Tracy Graydon","email":"tracy.graydon@intel.com","username":"tgraydon"},"message":"Change has been successfully merged into the git repository."}]}
